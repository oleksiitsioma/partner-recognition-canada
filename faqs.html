                    <p class="fmc-type--body1 fmc-type--bold fmc-mb-1">May customers purchase or lease?</p>
                    <p class="fmc-pl-1">Yes. They can purchase or lease any qualified vehicle in the New Vehicle Purchase Program provided they are qualified customers with a good credit rating. Financing, whether purchase or lease, may be obtained at the customer's discretion from any source.</p>
                </li>
                <li class="fmc-mb-4 fmc-type--body1 fmc-type--bold">
                    <p class="fmc-type--body1 fmc-type--bold fmc-mb-1">How long do customers have to keep an AXZD-Plan vehicle?</p>
                    <p class="fmc-pl-1">They must keep an AXZD-Plan vehicle in their possession and registered in their name for at least six months from the date of purchase or lease.</p>
                </li>
                <li class="fmc-mb-4 fmc-type--body1 fmc-type--bold">
                    <p class="fmc-type--body1 fmc-type--bold fmc-mb-1">Can I sell a used vehicle on the AXZD-Plan?</p>
                    <p class="fmc-pl-1">No. A used vehicle cannot be purchased with AXZD-Plan pricing. Plan sales are for new vehicles only.</p>
                </li>
                <li class="fmc-mb-4 fmc-type--body1 fmc-type--bold">
                    <p class="fmc-type--body1 fmc-type--bold fmc-mb-1">Can a dealer demonstrator be purchased on the AXZD-Plan program?</p>
                    <p class="fmc-pl-1">Yes. A dealer demonstrator vehicle is eligible using AXZD-Plan pricing. Ford no longer requires a demonstrator form to be signed because there is no limitation to the amount of miles on the vehicle. However, no additional discount is permitted beyond incentives compatible with an AXZD-Plan deal.</p>
                </li>
                <li class="fmc-mb-4 fmc-type--body1 fmc-type--bold">
                    <p class="fmc-type--body1 fmc-type--bold fmc-mb-1">Can an out-of-service Ford Courtesy Transportation (FCTP) vehicle be purchased on the AXZD-Plan program?</p>
                    <p class="fmc-pl-1">Yes. An out-of-service FCTP vehicle is eligible for AXZD-plan pricing. Dealers are required to pass on the in-service FCTP incentive to all AXZD-plan customers. No additional discount is permitted beyond incentives compatible with an AXZD-Plan deal.</p>
                </li>
                <li class="fmc-mb-4 fmc-type--body1 fmc-type--bold">
                    <p class="fmc-type--body1 fmc-type--bold fmc-mb-1">May I charge a "document fee" or other added fees? Is this allowed?</p>
                    <p class="fmc-pl-1">Yes. Dealers will be permitted to assess up to $75 in documentary fees on each A/Z-Plan delivery and up to $100 in documentary fees on each X-Plan and D-Plan delivery to an eligible purchaser under the terms of the plan unless otherwise provided by state or local laws or regulation. Each dealer is responsible for complying with applicable laws or regulations.</p>
                </li>
                <li class="fmc-mb-4 fmc-type--body1 fmc-type--bold">
                    <p class="fmc-type--body1 fmc-type--bold fmc-mb-1">What if I am in a state that allows me to charge more than $75?</p>
                    <p class="fmc-pl-1">Unless otherwise provided by state or local laws or regulations: In states where dealers are not permitted to charge as much as $75 for A/Z-Plan doc fees or $100 for X-Plan and D-Plan doc fees, dealers would be capped at the lesser amount as provided by the state. In states that permitted more than $75 or $100, dealers would be permitted to charge the AZ-Plan customer $75 and the X-Plan or D-Plan customer $100. In states that permitted more than $75 or $100 and also required that all customers be charged the same amount, dealers may charge the A/Z-Plan customer $75 and the X-Plan or D-Plan customer $100 and indicate any additional fees have been paid by Ford Motor Company as part of the AXZD-Plan Program dealer reimbursement on the buyer's order.</p>
                </li>

                    <p class="fmc-type--body1 fmc-type--bold fmc-mb-1">How does this change the $275 administration fee?</p>
                    <p class="fmc-pl-1">There is no change. The $275 administration fee covers costs of managing the New Vehicle Purchase Program and is not to be confused with a “document fee” charged by the dealer to the customer.</p>
                </li>
                <li class="fmc-mb-4 fmc-type--body1 fmc-type--bold">
                    <p class="fmc-type--body1 fmc-type--bold fmc-mb-1">Are customers eligible for other incentives?</p>
                    <p class="fmc-pl-1">Yes. AXZD-Plan customers are eligible for most public incentives and many incentives normally paid to the dealer. There are some special offers that are not compatible with the Plans. Customers are encouraged to contact a dealer to best determine which incentives they are eligible for.</p>
                </li>
                <li class="fmc-mb-4 fmc-type--body1 fmc-type--bold">
                    <p class="fmc-type--body1 fmc-type--bold fmc-mb-1">Are Plan customers eligible to receive dealer cash?</p>
                    <p class="fmc-pl-1">Yes. If the dealer cash offers an AXZD-Plan flat pay alternative, the full amount must be passed along to the customer.</p>
                </li>
                <li class="fmc-mb-4 fmc-type--body1 fmc-type--bold">
                    <p class="fmc-type--body1 fmc-type--bold fmc-mb-1">How does a Plan sale/lease affect the dealership's performance in a dealer cash stairstep program?</p>
                    <p class="fmc-pl-1">AZD-Plans sales are included as "counters" in most stair-step incentive programs. When these programs are reconciled, all counter vehicles (including AZD-Plans) are counted first, thus helping the dealership to achieve their various bonus levels. X-Plan sales in most stairstep programs are treated as retail.</p>
                </li>
                <li class="fmc-mb-4 fmc-type--body1 fmc-type--bold">
                    <p class="fmc-type--body1 fmc-type--bold fmc-mb-1">Are vehicle trade-in's allowed under these programs?</p>
                    <p class="fmc-pl-1">Yes. A customer may choose to trade in a vehicle while using this program. However, the dealer determines the amount of the vehicle trade in allowance. Dealerships should take extra time to explain the vehicle trade valuation process, as some Plan customers believe that vehicle trade valuations are unfair. Also, any vehicle trade negative equity has to be listed on the AXZD-Plan Pricing Agreement.</p>
                </li>
                <li class="fmc-mb-4 fmc-type--body1 fmc-type--bold">
                    <p class="fmc-type--body1 fmc-type--bold fmc-mb-1">How long are these New Vehicle Purchase Programs in effect?</p>
                    <p class="fmc-pl-1">There is no effective expiration date. However, Ford Motor Company reserves the right to modify the program, remove eligibility, or cancel the program at any time. In the case of D-Plan, the dealership must be certified for employees to be eligible for the program.</p>
                </li>
                <li class="fmc-mb-4 fmc-type--body1 fmc-type--bold">
                    <p class="fmc-type--body1 fmc-type--bold fmc-mb-1">Can a dealership advertise Plan Pricing?</p>
                    <p class="fmc-pl-1">Dealer advertising must be clear and state Plan pricing is available to eligible customers only. A dealership is not allowed to expressly represent or imply to the general public that Ford has authorized the dealer to offer Plans or the Plans' pricing to all potential customers.</p>
                </li>
                <li class="fmc-mb-4 fmc-type--body1 fmc-type--bold">
                    <p class="fmc-type--body1 fmc-type--bold fmc-mb-1">How long is a PIN valid?</p>
                    <p class="fmc-pl-1">Most PIN's remain active for 12 months from date of issue. However in cases of Affinity Offers an expiration date of less than 12 months may be generated on a given PIN based on the specific Affinity Offer.</p>
                </li>
                <li class="fmc-mb-4 fmc-type--body1 fmc-type--bold">
                    <p class="fmc-type--body1 fmc-type--bold fmc-mb-1">Are there restrictions on model years eligible?</p>
                    <p class="fmc-pl-1">New prior model year vehicles may be purchased or leased at AXZD-Plan pricing from dealer stock while supplies last.</p>
                </li>
                <li class="fmc-mb-4 fmc-type--body1 fmc-type--bold">
                    <p class="fmc-type--body1 fmc-type--bold fmc-mb-1">Can a vehicle be obtained for my business or for another person?</p>
                    <p class="fmc-pl-1">AZD-Plan vehicles cannot be titled to a business. They must be titled and registered in the eligible employee, retiree, eligible family member's name for a minimum of six months. However, X-Plan purchases may be titled in the name of a business (excluding in the name of a dealership and their leasing companies). PINs must be generated using the last 4 (four) digits of the company's federal tax identification number.</p>
                </li>
                <li class="fmc-mb-4 fmc-type--body1 fmc-type--bold">
                    <p class="fmc-type--body1 fmc-type--bold fmc-mb-1">What if the PIN provided doesn't work?</p>
                    <p class="fmc-pl-1">Customers may obtain a forgotten PIN or verify his/her PIN by logging onto the web site they obtained it, or contacting the call center. In either case, customers will need to reference their name and last four digits of Social Security Number or other ID as instructed in program materials.</p>
                </li>
                <li class="fmc-mb-4 fmc-type--body1 fmc-type--bold">
                    <p class="fmc-type--body1 fmc-type--bold fmc-mb-1">Are the New Vehicle Purchase Programs retroactive?</p>
                    <p class="fmc-pl-1">No. This special pricing offer is available only when a customer identifies himself or herself as a customer and provides a PIN prior to completing the purchase or lease transaction. The program is not retroactive.</p>
                </li>
                <li class="fmc-mb-4 fmc-type--body1 fmc-type--bold">
                    <p class="fmc-type--body1 fmc-type--bold fmc-mb-1">Can an E or F- Series Chassis be purchased or leased on the AXZD-Plan?</p>
                    <p class="fmc-pl-1">Yes. But remember, AZD-Plan purchases must be titled in an individual's name and may be only for personal use. In addition, vehicles under AZD-Plan may not be purchased or leased for commercial use. However, X-Plan purchases may be titled in the name of a business (excluding automotive dealerships and their leasing companies), and therefore used commercially. PINs must be generated using the last 4 (four) digits of the company's federal tax identification number. Note, only F-150® through F-450® (W42 and W43 pickups only) are available on AXZD-Plan.</p>

                    <p class="fmc-pl-1">No, this is in direct violation of the program rules. Dealership employees may not find customers for sponsors and may not solicit or purchase PINs from a sponsor to give to a customer.</p>
